title: Slices and segments

# Slices

Slices are the second level in the organizational hierarchy of Feature-Sliced Design. Their main purpose is to group code by its meaning for the product, business or just the application.

The names of slices are not standardized because they are directly determined by the business domain of your application. For example, a photo gallery might have slices `photo`, `create-album`, `gallery-page`. A social network would require different slices, for example, `post`, `add-user-to-friends`, `news-feed`.

The layers Shared and App don't contain segments. That is because Shared should contain no business logic at all, hence has no meaning for the product, and App should contain only code that concerns the entire application, so no splitting is necessary.

# Segments

Segments are the third and final level in the organizational hierarchy, and their purpose is to group code by its technical nature.

There a few standardized segment names:
* `ui` — UI components, data formatting functions
* `model` — data storage, functions to manipulate this data
* `lib` — logic of data manipulation, event handlers, auxiliary code
* `api` — communication with external APIs, backend API methods

Custom segments are permitted, but should be created sparingly. The most common places for custom segments are the App layer and the Shared layer, where slices don't make sense.

## Dividing by slices

### Entities

Every slice should be devoted to a single entity. To determine entities for your app, a good starting-off point is to use database entities (table names) from the backend, however, entities are not only limited to database tables.

For example, the podcast player _Cast_ (see it in [project examples][examples--cast]) contains an `audio` entity which represents a concept from the technical vocabulary, but does not correspond to a database entity.

### Features

A single action, either done by the user or by the app on their behalf, deserves its own slice. When there are many related small actions, they can be grouped together into one slice with several exports to keep the slices clean.

For example, for a photo gallery app, creating an album, renaming an album and sharing an album can be grouped into a single slice `album`, but uploading photos and editing them could be placed into separate slices, `upload-photo` and `edit-photo` respectively.

### Widgets/Pages

A single widget/page usually deserves its own slice, however, in the same way as with features, several widgets that are closely related to a single entity can be grouped together.

### Other layers

For layers that are little concerned with business logic, division by slices is unnecessary, which is why layers Shared and App usually consist directly of segments.
